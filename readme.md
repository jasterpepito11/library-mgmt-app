## Libra Integrated Library System

A simple book management application that uses [React] + [Vite âš¡] + [RTK Query] + [Firebase (Authentication, Storage and Firestore)]

I also used:

- React-Bootstrap (for Bootstrap v5.2)
- React Router v6
- React Toastify for notif alerts
- Formik and Yup for form creation and validation

## All the assets used for this project I created using [AdobeExpress](https://express.adobe.com/sp/)
# [Live Demo](https://libra-ils.firebaseapp.com)

## Getting started

To get the app running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server (this project Vite)
